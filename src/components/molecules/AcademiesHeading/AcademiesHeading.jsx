      There are four disciplines available: for developers, testers, front-end
      developers and kids. Academies are taking place in Devbridge Lithuanian
      offices. Students, who are willing to join developers, testers or
      Front-End academies, need to pass the test, prove their best to get an
      invitation to enroll. This rule doesnâ€™t apply to the kids (7 to 12 years
      old) academy, the admission is limited only by available number of
      entries.
